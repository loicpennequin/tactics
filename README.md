## GETTING STARTED

-   clone repo
-   make sure MySQL is started
-   `npm install`
-   follow the command line to create your environnement file for the server
-   `npm run dev` will start the server and the electron app
-   `npm run start:server` will only start the server
-   `npm run start:client` will only start the electorn app (not really relevant since the server is needed)
-   `npm run build:app` will build and package the electron app, and build the installer
